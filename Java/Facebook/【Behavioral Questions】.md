# Behavioral Question 准备：

#### 1、Tell me about yourself
I am Nianze Liu who is a master student from Cornell ECE. My concentration is Computer Engineering and I am solid in Java. I have some backend experience and have been an intern under Oracle's Weblogic Server team this summer. Right now I'm focusing on becoming a full stack developer and is working on building Android and web applications this semester. In my leisure time, I like to play the clarinet and piano as well as photography.

#### 2、What is your most Challenging project
* My Intern project in Oracle (IPCDS):
Reference to 6.

* The Ocalf:
This is the project in CS3110 functional programming course. I was required to develope an interpreter for a sub-language called OCalf, which is a functional language containing many of the core features of OCaml. This project is suggested to be done in group of two, but I did it alone because my teamate quit the course. After programming as language users for many years, this time I have to be a language designer for this baby language and implement a big-step environment model semantics, including features such as closures and type inference. The concept is totally new to me and the language I used is Ocaml which I had just started to use. To conquer it I carefully searched and read related articles online as well as discussion on piazza, and asked my TA in the office hour. Luckily I finished the project on time. It was very excited When the ocalf interpreter work as I expected.

I've heard that Facebook has introduced a new interface to OCaml named Reason. I'm quit interested in this project.

#### 3、Why FB?
Some of my best friends work in Facebook and they tell me they really enjoy their jobs here. And I’ve heard that onboard policy here in Facebook is very nice to new-grad, which is known as bootcamp, where new comers may easily get onboard and learn a lot during the process. 

#### 4. Where do you see yourself in five years?
In the next 5 years, I want to become an experienced full-stack engineer. I have some backend experience during my internship in Oracle, where I developed codes to help improve the server's memory density in order to save some money for Oracle. This semester I’m more focusing on the front-end side, doing projects related with Android and web development. I hope I can combine my previous experience in front-end and back-end to become a good full stack developer and plan to start with some projects using the MEAN stack. (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) this winter as a side project. 

#### 5. What are your weaknesses / What are the areas where you need to improve your skills / Are there areas where you need to develop your skills further?
One thing I need to improve for myself is that I tend to be a procastinator for things I don't like so I need to change my time management strategy to improve my overall efficiency. 
For example, when given a bunch of tasks at the same time, I intend to rank the task priority according to my interests. For my favorite ones, say building a cool mobile application or write a text adventure game engine, I may spend too much time just want to make a best result, but this may lead to a bad situation where for the remainging topics that does not appeal to me very much, say writing some reports, I may put them off until the last minute and ending up with no enough time to make a good.result
Recently I'm following the principle of pomodoro technique as my time management strategy. I decide the order of tasks according to their importance and deadline, make up a task queue, and finish them one by one in pomodoro intervals. I think this may be a good habit to improve my efficiency.

#### 6. What do you like least about your previous job/internship / What do you dislike the most about your last job?
My intern in Oracle requires me to learn the ASM to deal with the Java bytecode, which involves a lot of new concepts and details in the JVM that I was not familiar with. The problem I had in the past is that I thought I could easily handle the challenges and therefore promise to take many tasks at once because as a new comer, I thought it's a good opportunity to involve everything. 
However, I've learned that I'm not at my best when I have too many conflicting priorities. I've had to cut back on some of the less important tasks to focus on familiarize myself with the ASM tool. So after I realize that my ability is not as good as I thought, I communicated with my mentor about the delivery schedule. He helped me focus on both the timing and the quality of the delivery. Luckily in the end, all the tasks were delivered with high quality results.

#### 7. Describe a situation where you exceeded expectations/did more than required
In the final project of functional programming course we were required to use OCaml to build a small application. My group built a simple client side database system with two shining points: one is that the data storage process adopted the LRU cache strategy to improve the data retrieval performance; another feature is that we want to visualize the data, so we built a module with ability to draw the histogram figure according to the query table content in the terminal. These two features earned us extra points in the end.

#### 8. Have you ever had a conflict with the team? How was it resolved? (最好举例)
In the large scale course, once there was a project with a base requirement and an extra point task. My teammate only wanted to finish the base task but I thought the extra point was not hard to complete, and it would be great to finish all the tasks. So we had a conflict on this point. 
After communication, I learned that my teammate had to schedule enough time to prepare for the final exam, so he did not have enought time for our course project. Since my time schedule was more flexible, I offered to complete the extra point task myself, and leave the base assignment for him to complete.
